Passcode input obfuscation generator.

User can be observed entering their password and
still be safe as long as the person observing 
doesn't record multiple entries.

each 'group' of letters will be in a circle,
probably four circles in a diamond shape will do:

       O
    O     O 
       O       

ex. passcode = 'munch'

---------
1.  _  _  _  _  _      
    B        L         W          P
  M   E    Q   V    D     J     A   I
    F        O         K          Y

This represents the first character of their password.
This would repeat 5 times. 

5.  *  *  *  *  _
(with different characters, and including the 'H')   
    B        L         W          P
  M   E    Q   V    D     J     A   I
    F        O         K          Y

Important:
-   in each generation of 4 circles, no letters 
    can be used twice.
-   A visual representation of what character
    the user is inputing will be shown, ex:
    _ _ _ _ _   or   * * * _ _
-
